 │   ├── api
 │   ├── admin
 │   └── gateway
 │
 ├── packages
 │   ├── shared
 │   ├── logger
 │   └── config
 │
 └── deployment
```

---

# Benefits of Monorepo

Testing interactions between services becomes simpler.

---

# Boilerplate Philosophy

This boilerplate focuses on:

- Clean architecture
- Scalability
- Performance
- Maintainability
- Production readiness
- Developer productivity

The goal is to provide a strong starting foundation for backend systems ranging from small projects to enterprise-scale applications.

# Project Structure

```txt
.
├── backend/
├── node_modules/
├── package/
├── package.json
├── turbo.json
├── bun.lock
└── README.md
```

---

# Folder & File Explanation

## `backend/`

This folder contains the Go backend application.

Usually includes:

- API server
- business logic
- database layer
- routes
- middleware
- services

Example:

```txt
backend/
 ├── cmd/
 ├── internal/
 ├── pkg/
 ├── configs/
 └── go.mod
```

This is the core backend part of the boilerplate.

---

## `node_modules/`

This folder contains installed JavaScript/TypeScript dependencies.

Generated automatically when running:

```bash
bun install
```

Contains packages like:

- turbo
- typescript
- eslint
- prettier

---

### Why We Normally Ignore It in Git

`node_modules` can become extremely large.

Instead of uploading dependencies to GitHub, developers upload:

- `package.json`
- `bun.lock`

Other developers can reinstall dependencies using:

```bash
bun install
```

---

## `package/`

This folder usually contains shared packages/libraries inside the monorepo.

Example:

```txt
package/
 ├── logger/
 ├── config/
 ├── types/
 └── utils/
```

These shared packages can be reused across multiple applications.

---

### Why Shared Packages are Useful

They help avoid duplicate code.

Example:

instead of creating logger code in every app, create it once:

```txt
package/logger
```

and reuse everywhere.

---

## `package.json`

This is the main configuration file for JavaScript/TypeScript tooling.

It defines:

- scripts
- dependencies
- workspaces
- package manager
- project metadata

Example responsibilities:

- running development servers
- linting
- formatting
- monorepo management

---

### Example Commands

```bash
bun run dev
bun run build
bun run lint
```

All are defined inside `package.json`.

---

## `turbo.json`

Configuration file for Turborepo.

Controls:

- task execution
- caching
- dependency pipelines
- monorepo orchestration

Example:

```json
{
  "tasks": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    }
  }
}
```

This tells Turbo:

- build dependent packages first
- optimize execution

---

## `bun.lock`

Lock file generated by Bun.

Stores exact dependency versions.

---

### Why Lock Files are Important

Without lock files:

different developers may install different package versions.

This can create:

- inconsistent behavior
- bugs
- build failures

`bun.lock` ensures everyone uses the exact same dependency versions.

---

## `README.md`

Project documentation file.

Usually contains:

- setup instructions
- project structure
- tooling explanation
- architecture overview
- development workflow
- commands

This helps developers understand and contribute to the boilerplate quickly.

---

# Why This Structure is Useful

This structure provides:

- scalability
- clean organization
- monorepo support
- reusable packages
- easier maintenance
- production-ready tooling

It is suitable for:

- backend systems
- full-stack applications
- microservices
- enterprise projects
